# BNPMediation

The goal of BNPMediation is to provide a function `bnpmediation()` that provides the posterior means and credible intervals of the effects of mediation. Bayesian Nonparametric (BNP) models are used for the observed data to identify and estimate the causal effects. 

## Installation

You can install BNPMediation from github with:


```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mjdaniels/BNPMediationProject")
```
